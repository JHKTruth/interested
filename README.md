Project for playing around with Lamba architecture.

Allows creation of Pulse which others around the area can subscribe to and when good the group can gogo *-*. For example driving down and one sees a restaurant that one wants to eat at and friends are too far away; create a pulse, get others to join up, and go together xD. Allows chatting for the pulse group as well as creating private chat lobbies.
