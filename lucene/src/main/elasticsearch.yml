# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install lang-python
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: pulsing
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: pulsing-mac
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
node.master: true
node.data: true

# It's best practice to disable ingest in master and data noe to prevent ingestion error issues
# and to protect the cluster. The client node is the best candidate to be also ingest ones
node.ingest: true
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
# When multiple for path.data they are managed a la RAID 0 (their space is sum up), favoring
# locations with most free space
path.data: ./data

# location when Elasticsearch stores temporary files
#path.work: ./work
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: ./logs

# override the plugins path (default is $ES_HOME/plugins)
#path.plugins: ./plugins
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
# To control memory swapping
# The other settings for memory prevent ES swapping memory and give a performance boost in a production environment
# This setting is required because during indexing and searching ES creates and destroys a lot of objects in memory.
# This large number of create/destroy actions fragments the memory reducing performances: the memory becomes full 
# of holes and when the system needs to allocate more memory it suffers an overhead to find compacted memory. 
# If you don't set boostrap.memory_lock: true, ES dumps the whole process memory on disk and defragments it back 
# in memory, freezing the system. With this setting, the defragmentation step is done all in memory, with a huge 
# performance boost.
#
bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
# Defines the IP of your machine to be used in bind the node. If your server is on different 
# LANs or you want to limit the bind on only a LAN, you must set this value with your server IP.
#
network.host: 127.0.0.1
#
# Set a custom port for HTTP:
#
#http.port: 9200
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when new node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
# Your node is configured to bind on all your machine interfaces and does discovery broadcasting 
# events to the nodes listed in discovery...hosts. This means that it sends signals to the machine 
# in unicast list and waits for a response. If a node responds to it, they can join in a cluster.
#
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["pulsing.jhk.org", "127.0.0.1"]
#
# Prevent the "split brain" by configuring the majority of nodes (total number of master-eligible nodes / 2 + 1):
#
#discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 3
#
# For more information, consult the zen discovery module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Gateway -----------------------------------
#
# Block initial recovery after a full cluster restart until N nodes are started:
#
#gateway.recover_after_nodes: 3
#
# For more information, consult the gateway module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
#
#action.destructive_requires_name: true
