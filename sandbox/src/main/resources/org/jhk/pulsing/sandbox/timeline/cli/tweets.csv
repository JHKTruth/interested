643576332438388737,989489610,1442275529,@marcua oooo I want to hear/read the story! These are my kind of bugs!
643486000384049152,989489610,1442253992,@viktorklang @pbailis @neha I think I agree with this thread: a) CC aborts are surprising b) retries are also easy to screw up
643067008838320130,989489610,1442154097,@pcalcado I think this *the* reason to use microservices: organization and process. The first "value stream" sadly looks very familiar :)
643057991370080256,989489610,1442151947,@jay_gee good option during rush hours. When the roads aren't busy a cab is 30 mins for $53 plus tolls and tip; I only rarely take the train
639845739699437569,989489610,1441386086,@yschimke I think I know exactly what conversation this is referring to. I'm not sure I was actually able to help though.
635808498622685184,989489610,1440423533,@giltene @ArielWeisberg Twitter's JVM does that for some things (thanks @cvarming @TonyPrintezis, team), but not GC log. Maybe it should?
635638758050664448,989489610,1440383064,Work on important problems, ignore metrics, teach well; *everyone* should follow @mattmight's advice on tenure: http://t.co/HqXu9mEcYM
635559599408586752,989489610,1440364191,@giltene thanks! In this case: the api doesn't look like IO, so I bet people didn't even think about it
634481787742236672,989489610,1440107220,@ArielWeisberg read a bit of code: hotspot calls gclog_or_tty-&gt;flush() a few places in a safepoint; probably can block it on rare occasions?
634465817069883392,989489610,1440103413,@ArielWeisberg guessing it is less likely? file must be dirty, then write-out from FS, then GC/safepoint logs; stats file is *always* dirty
634438427187019776,989489610,1440096882,@AlTobey @ArielWeisberg don't even need to remount. Pauses can be triggered with dd. See the bottom of http://t.co/07fKycNjoc to repro
634437890991353856,989489610,1440096755,@ArielWeisberg logs write to a buffered file, I only tested mmap; possible but i don't know without testing it
634413686044631042,989489610,1440090984,@neha @marius @wm @BuoyantIO ha excellent! I'd love details about gc avoidance in prod; as would @mnnakamura who worked on it in finagle
629627829093662720,989489610,1438949947,I don't think "co-founder" should be a job title, its a footnote. It bug me when someone gets the title well after the company was founded.
629320985619992576,989489610,1438876789,@hongrich Ah, interesting! Having written a checker based on that code, it should be pretty easy to fix that limitation.
629318874517757952,989489610,1438876286,@hongrich yeah, closure capture is basically the same error, but go vet already checks for it.
628972257537208320,989489610,1438793646,@edwardbenson Thanks! You mean with using closures in a loop? (go also has this problem, but go vet checks for it)
628961752110116864,989489610,1438791141,In Go: don't take the address of loop variables; easier mistake than I thought. (bonus: an example automated checker) http://t.co/33AqlDrWOO

603713601984135169,989489610,1432771513,@cvarming except then it would skip my stop! Seriously: I recall an article saying it would skip the busiest stops on the f if it did that

583655828449665024,989489610,1427989367,@SeanTAllen Did you ever find out if this was the cause of your weird JVM pauses?

581201769276960768,989489610,1427404274,@bitbckt Agree its not ideal. Twitter's JVM team has been awesome and are looking at a real fix, as are Hotspot devs: http://t.co/6FaYFkExpk
581199712167940096,989489610,1427403784,@bitbckt trade-offs. I don't use jstat; jstack still works. Using a RAM disk requires system config or symlinks. The flag works on all JVMs.
581197790304301056,989489610,1427403325,@nelhage @JorgeO I wasn't that smart :( Give me a day or so to finish writing, but basically a lot of looking at random graphs and logs.
581174316730990592,989489610,1427397729,@JorgeO I'm on it! The blog post was getting too long so I wanted to get the technical details out.
581154389613621248,989489610,1427392978,@SeanTAllen If this turns out to be the cause, I'd love to hear it. It was a config diff like this that let me figure it out (future post)
581152570598551552,989489610,1427392544,@SeanTAllen Similar symptoms? high real time, low user + system? Related links in my post have other things to look at; weren't my problem
581147928758071296,989489610,1427391438,@SeanTAllen It does *not* happen if the mmaped writes are to a file on tmpfs. I should call that out more clearly in my post ...
581117094919450625,989489610,1427384086,@nelhage can't change the path without recompiling the JVM (os::get_temp_directory); -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem works and breaks few things
581114504785727489,989489610,1427383469,@nelhage Good point. Maybe the kernel could OOM kill, like it would for anonymous mmap? Kernels are hard; they must handle everything.
581107707014299648,989489610,1427381848,@arvind__t Depends; on systems with magnetic disk and lots of IO it may affect the 95th and 90th percentile as well.
581107376897581057,989489610,1427381769,@nelhage Thanks, looks potentially relevant. Still surprised something blocks mmaped writes. JVM authors didn't expect that either.

537433289192398849,989489610,1416969055,@MathiasHansen the reality is this is part of the reason Mitro wasn't commercially viable: It doesn't solve a valuable enough problem. :(

526137188128653312,989489610,1414275855,@davecheney @enneff I couldn't have said it better. I think erring on the side of minimal is the right policy.
526125018749865984,989489610,1414272954,Frameworks have a deserved bad rep. However, I think good ones are needed for large-scale software (even in Go): http://t.co/RhmVAB3eB0
526124815682633728,989489610,1414272905,@davecheney @enneff I have a pretty broad definition of framework. net/http counts, and is an example of a good one: http://t.co/RhmVAB3eB0
526062903246729216,989489610,1414258144,@alambert ah, makes sense; but what about hw limits? A hw root key and software to manage child keys?
524751925909389313,989489610,1413945583,@enneff @davecheney true; I've just been thinking about big programs. Some abstractions=useful, others=pain. I want to understand the diff
524749133719302144,989489610,1413944917,@davecheney @enneff although net/http takes calls your handlers "magically" :) I like @enneff's "few demands on structure"
524742575216140288,989489610,1413943353,@enneff @davecheney I worked in the old c++ era. Heck of a lot more than RPC came with the default server. Isn't that a framework?
524742072327475200,989489610,1413943233,@davecheney probably the issue. What is a framework? this convo is probably be too nuanced for twitter. Maybe I need to write a blog post
524733055182045184,989489610,1413941084,@davecheney I'm not a fan of frameworks, but at GOOG and TWTR: the "standard" server provides useful infra.; looks a bit like a framework
524731813642903552,989489610,1413940788,@davecheney what about for big programs/orgs? everyone assembles their own routing/logs/stats/rpc/etc? Are frameworks a "bad abstraction"?
524378062465798145,989489610,1413856447,@Sstack83 @timbray is this satire? If not, this sure proved Tim's point.

492722113430577153,989489610,1406309080,@hyc_symas It could also be the sector checksum? So the disk doesn't let you read the partial write ("Unrecovered read error" in my test)?
